# Nix-Encoder
This is a simple python application that allows a user to encrypt and decrypt messages. This app uses a modified verison of the Affine cipher where the two keywords are turned into large prime numbers to encrypt the message. 

# Using Nix-Ecoder

Note: You can use py-to-exe converter to compile the code yourself.
